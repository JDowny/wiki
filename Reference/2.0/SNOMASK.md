# Configuring SNOMASKs

To set SNOMASKs, set user mode +s with the server notice masks you want as a parameter to the mode.
For example, to see local and remote connections and quit notices, execute the following command:

`/MODE YourNick +s +cCqQ`

To enable automatic setting of SNOMASKs upon opering, load [m_opermodes](/wiki/Modules/opermodes.html)
and set the modes in `<type:automodes>`. For example:

```XML
<type name="GlobalOp" 
  classes="OperChat BanControl HostCloak Modular" 
  host="globalop.chatspike.net" 
  automodes="+s +cCqQ">
```

To remove a SNOMASK, set user mode +s again, but remove masks by sending a 'negative' change. For
example, to disable remote connection and quit notices, execute the following command:

`/MODE YourNick +s -CQ`

To disable all server notice masks, simply remove user mode +s entirely:

`/MODE YourNick -s`

A list of the valid server notice masks and what they do is listed below. 

## Channel Logging

You can use the [m_chanlog](/wiki/Modules/chanlog.html) module
to send messages to a channel of your choice. You can even have multiple channels for different
masks. Use local masks on every server to the same channel to receive messages globally in the
channel.
