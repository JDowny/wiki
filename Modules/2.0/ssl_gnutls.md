### gnutls

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
starttls | bool | controls whether STARTTLS functionality is enabled (default) or not
advertisedports | string | the value of this setting overrides the default `SSL=IP:PORT` line displayed in the 005 (ISUPPORT) numeric
dhbits | int | number of bits 
hash | string | hash algorithm to use when checking signatures, possible values: "md5" and "sha1". Defaults to md5 for compatibility reasons, use sha1 whenever possible
priority | string | a priority string to determine the order for ciphers, hash functions etc. Defaults to "NORMAL", see Extra resources section for further description
certfile | string | the certificate (chain) that will be sent to clients and possibly other servers
keyfile | string | the private key for your certificate
cafile | string | a certificate authority 
crlfile | string | a certificate revocation list
dhfile | string | a file containing DiffieÂ–Hellman parameters (or DH parameters, DH primes) TODO


Certificates should be in **PEM format**.

### Certificates

#### Your server certificate

This certificate is sent to all connecting clients, and therefore it's necessary to have one in order to use this module.
Your server certificate is read from `certfile`, and its accompaning private key is read from `keyfile`.

(Note: `cafile` and `crlfile` have nothing to do with your server certificate, see the [Client Certificates](ssl_gnutls.md#client-certificates)
section)

##### Using a self-signed certificate

A self-signed certificate is generated and installed for you if you answer yes when prompted by 'configure'.
This works out of the box, no further configuration is necessary.

##### Using an existing certificate

To use an existing certificate first make sure it is in **PEM** format and check if the *certificate and the private key are in seperate files*.
Your certificate (`certfile') should look like this:

    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    ...
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

If it looks like

    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    ...
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----


then you need to move the private key ( **including** header and footer) into a second file (`keyfile`). Any simple text 
editor can do this.

If the format doesn't match any of the above, then the certificate is probably **not** in PEM format and you need to 
[convert it](ssl_gnutls.md#converting-certificate-format) first.

###### Certificate chains

If your certificate is signed by a CA, then `certfile` needs to contain all certificates in the verification chain. 
These extra certificates could be included in a separate file (called a CA bundle) provided by the CA.
To use them, simply concatenate them in `certfile`. Your certificate (the one you have a private key for) should be 
on the top.

    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    your certificate
    ...
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    another certificate
    ...
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    a third certificate
    ...
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----


You can check the order using
`gnutls-cli irc.example.com -p 6697`

Note: InspIRCd will not complain if you don't supply the necessary certificates in the chain, but clients **will**
report errors, as they won't be able to verify your certificate.

### Client certificates

SSL provides the ability for both the client and the server to present a certificate for verification. In most cases, 
this is not used: only the server presents a certificate, and the client does not identify itself at all (or uses 
other means, such as a username/password).

InspIRCd will accept client certificates if your IRC client offers one during the SSL connection. The fingerprint of 
this client certificate is viewable with the [`/SSLINFO`](sslinfo.md) command, and can be used for NickServ 
authentication in place of the normal username/password. For information on how to create a client certificate and 
on how to set up common clients, look at [OFTC's page on CertFP setup](http://www.oftc.net/oftc/NickServ/CertFP).

You can also use a CA to validate client certificates - that is, the individual users' certificates that they use 
to connect to your server.

This can be used by connect blocks to match trusted certificates using `<connect requiressl="trusted">` 
(this requires [m_sslinfo](sslinfo.md)).

This is what `ca.pem` and `crl.pem` are used for. You do not need them for anything else, and if you are **not** 
checking client certificates, **you can ignore their error messages**.

## Commands

`STARTTLS`

While `STARTTLS` is technically a command, is used by IRC clients rather than users.

If enabled, it allows supporting clients to use SSL without having a dedicated SSL port.

## User Modes

This module implements no user modes.

## SNOMASK

This module implements no server notice masks.

## Channel Modes

This module implements no channel modes.

## Extended Bans

This module implements no extended bans.

## Special Notes

**WARNING**: Unloading this module will automatically disconnect ALL users and servers that are connected via GnuTLS.

### Converting Certificate Format

Converting from PKCS7/DER to PEM:

`openssl pkcs8 -nocrypt -inform DER -outform PEM -in input.key -out output.pem`

Converting from PKCS#12 to PEM:

`openssl pkcs12 -nodes -nocerts -in input.p12 -out output.pem`
