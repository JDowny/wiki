## Welcome

Hello, and welcome to the InspIRCd Wiki and Documentation project!

Here are some resources that may (or may not!) be useful:

* If you're stuck, the [Installation](/wiki/Installation.md)
and [Configuration](/wiki/Configuration.md) pages might help
get you going again.

* Are you interested in [Contributing](/wiki/Contributing.md)?
We'd love to hear from you!

* The [FAQ](/wiki/FAQ.md) is a good place to start looking if
you're new or curious!

* To implement server software that talks to InspIRCd, the [Spanning Tree Protocol](/wiki/Modules/spanningtree/Protocol.md)
documentation might be useful.

* If you spot a bug in the documentation then file an [issue](https://github.com/inspircd/wiki/issues)
or a [pull request](https://github.com/inspircd/wiki/pulls).

* If you'd like to talk to us, we're on IRC (of course) on [irc.chatspike.net #inspircd](irc://irc.chatspike.net/inspircd),
but please make sure you read the [channel rules](/wiki/IRC-Channel-Rules.md)
first!
