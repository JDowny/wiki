[#InspIRCd](irc://irc.chatspike.net/inspircd) Channel Rules
===========================================================

As with most IRC channels, the support channel has rules. These rules are as follows:

* The main purpose of the channel is for support and discussion of InspIRCd. Other off-topic
discussion is allowed, but keep it to a minimum when on-topic discussion is happening.

* When asking for support make sure to state your full InspIRCd version as well as your Operating
System name/version and compiler name/version.

* We are here to contribute to the project in some way. Contribute positively. Avoid flaming and
arguments.

* Constructive criticism directly related to InspIRCd or an module of InspIRCd is welcomed. By
constructive this means you must give recommendations of how it should be improved.

* Outright bashing of people, programs, and ideas without a reasoned argument (e.g. just "its crap")
its frowned upon and makes you look an idiot.

* If you find a bug, PLEASE report it to the [bugtracker](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues)
rather than the channel. This makes processing it much easier to manage.

* Please use a [pastebin](http://nopaste.snit.ch) if you wish to contribute config file snippets or
code to the channel, rather than pasting, or you will be automatically kicked.

* No stupid scripts please (e.g. l33tsp33k-converters, 'thanks for the op' scripts, etc).

* Idlers are welcome on #InspIRCd. Helpful people are even more welcome!
